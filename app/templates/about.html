          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Robata <span class="text-danger">Tradition</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">In Japanese, Robata means "by the fireside" and refers to the centuries-old country style cooking of northern Japanese fisherman. Evenings in coastal villages found fisherman cooking their catch over an open fire, then sharing among themselves by passing food on oars from boat to boat. Our menu honors the Robata tradition of sharing and sampling.  Appetizer-size portions allow you to feast on a variety of authenitc Robata dishes.  Delicious possiblities are limited only by the whims of your palate and size of your appetite.  We hope you'll enjoy this unique, free-style dining at Robata Grill.  The warm, friendly atmosphere of open flame cooking adds to any meal, anywhere in the world.</p>

          <p class="lead">Shinji was born and raised in Osaka, Japan. Arguably the food capital of Japan. Working in restaurants at a very early age, he learned from some of the best chefs in the city and after many years of training he became Itamae (head sushi chef).  He was asked to travel to San Francisco to train prospects in the art of sushi making for the trade that was about to boom.  Shinji has been making sushi in Marin for over 20 years and 14 of them at Robata.  He is currently a part owner and lives with his wife and 2 daughters in Mill Valley. </p>
